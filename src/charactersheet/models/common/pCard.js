# pCard Specification

*A pCard is a structure used to summarize a player's information similar
to how a vCard does for chat systems.*

All fields on a pCard contain both attributes and values that are useful
for different purposes. All entries are in the following format:

    //pCard
    {
     entries: [
        {
            id: a unique id.
            name: a name for the given entry type.
            attr: any meta-data attributes for the item.
            value: the value of the given entry.
        },
        // ...
     ]
    }
