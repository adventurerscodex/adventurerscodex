Experience the next step in tabletop RPGs


What is it?
===========

A fun, easy to use, Open Source tool for tabletop RPG players to manage their characters, campaigns, and parties. Our goal is to help you focus more on the game by bringing your paper character sheets into the 21st century.

Check out the [site][ac], or follow our [blog][blog].


FOR PLAYERS
-----------

Keep track of you character's equipment, skills, spells, saving throws, and more. Say goodbye to that eraser-marked character sheet, and say hello to the future!


FOR DMS
-------

Manage your campaign by keeping track of enemies, and friendly NPCs, as well as any notes, maps, custom items, and whatever else you've created!

**Coming soon...**


FOR ENTIRE PARTIES
------------------

Take advantage of innovative features like group chat, advanced time-tracking, terrain visualizations, custom item sets, and a combat management tool!

**Coming soon...**
