# Version Feature Forecast

This document is intended to be an official place to lay out the future of Adventurer's Codex **at a high level.** While the details of this document are in no way binding, it is intended to be an evolving guide.


## A Living Document

This is intended to change/grow over time. As stated, the details of this document are both non-binding, and constantly changing. But it does give some indication as to the future of Adventurer's Codex at a high level.

Pull Requests are welcome.


## Version Forecast

Per-major version, what features would we like to have added? Note: **big fixes do not count toward feature lists**. We all need to work toward fixing bugs, but barring anything major, they are not the planned focus of new feature releases.


### v1.0

- A complete character sheet for players to keep track of their character data.
- Support for multiple characters
- Support for tablet devices as well as desktop browsers


### v1.1

- Autofilling Templates during character creation
- An enhanced wizard with more steps to guide people through (or a Skip button which creates an empty char)
- Better Profile Image management/options
- Planning for DM tools (not implementation)


### v1.2

- simple DM tools
  - Campaign creation
  - Encounter management (enemies, and items per encounter)
  - A log (notes)
- Planning for Syncing Services (maybe backend implementation)
- Status modifiers for players (see: #645)


### v1.3

- simple syncing features
  - player summaries
  - chat (group and 1-to-1)
- A new "combat module" which would need to be spec-ed out, but basically it shows the current enemies from the Encounter and the current players (the DM could see stats for all/some?)


### v1.4

- Better Dropbox Integration (permanent storage/file management/profile pictures/etc)
  - Automatic saving/loading to/from Dropbox (sync basically)
